# Ensemble-Method-for-Classification
Uses the wine quality data for predicting wine quality into 3 classes using Random Forest classification and Boosting classification. Uses the GridsearchCV() for each method and computes F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. It then displays the best hyperparameters for each classification method.
